## About Honeycomb

[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io) lets you collect and track data and events for debugging and trend analysis. During your continuous deployment workflow with Codeship Pro, you can use Honeycomb to log information related to your deployments or tests.

By using Honeycomb you can more easily track, troubleshoot and debug your applications.

[Their documentation](https://honeycomb.io/docs/) does a great job of providing more information, in addition to the setup instructions below.

## Codeship Pro

### Setting Your Team Write Key

You will need to add your Honeycomb Team Write Key to your [encrypted environment variables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/environment-variables.md %}) that you encrypt and include in your [codeship-services.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/services.md %}).

###  Sending Events And Markers

Next, you will need to add your Honeycomb API calls to a new script, placed in your repository, that you will call from your [codeship-steps.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/steps.md %}). For example:

```shell
curl https://api.honeycomb.io/1/batch/Dataset%20Name -X POST \
  -H "YOUR TEAM: YOUR_WRITE_KEY" \
  -d '[
        {
          "time":"2017-02-09T02:00:00Z",
          "data":{"key1":"val1","key2":"val2"}
        },
        {
          "data":{"key3":"val3"}
        }
      ]'
```

Once you have put an API call similar to the one above in a script in your repository, you will call that script from a new step in your [codeship-steps.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/steps.md %}). For instance:

```yaml
- name: honeycomb
  service: app
  command: honeycomb.sh
```

If you want to limit this step only to certain branches, for instance on deployments, you can use the [tag]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/steps.md %}/#limiting-steps-to-specific-branches-or-tags) option. For instance:

```yaml
- name: honeycomb
  service: app
  tag: master
  command: honeycomb.sh
```

### Using Honeymarker

Honeycomb also provides [Honeymarker](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeymarker) to make it even easier to use markets within your specific datasets.

#### Installing Honeymarker

To use [Honeymarker](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeymarker), you will need to install the tool into one of the services defined via your [codeship-services.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/services.md %}).

In the Dockerfile for the service you are building, or in the Dockerfile for a new Honeymarker service, you will need to add:

```dockerfile
RUN go get github.com/honeycombio/honeymarker
RUN honeymarker
```

**Note** that Honeymarker installs via `go get`, requiring that Go is installed in the same container.

#### Running Honeymarker Commands

Once you have Honeymarker installed via a new service in your [codeship-services.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/services.md %}), you will need to run Honeymarker commands as a new step, using the service with Honeymarker installed, in your [codeship-steps.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/steps.md %}):

```yaml
- name: honeymarker
  service: your_service
  command: "honeymarker -k <your-writekey> -d <dataset> COMMAND [command-specific flags]"
```

You can view the [Honeymarker documentation](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeymarker) for a full list of commands that you can use.

## Codeship Basic

### Setting Your Team Write Key

You will need to add your Honeycomb Team Write Key to your to your project's [environment variables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/builds-and-configuration/set-environment-variables.md %}).

You can do this by navigating to _Project Settings_ and then clicking on the _Environment_ tab.

###  Sending Events And Markers

Next, you will need to add your Honeycomb API calls to your test or deployment commands.

If you are logging events from your test pipelines, you will want to add the Honeycomb API call - or call a script in your repository with the API call commands in it - via your [test commands]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/quickstart/getting-started.md %}).

Or, if you are calling the Honeycomb API during deployments you will want to use a [custom-script deployment step]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/builds-and-configuration/deployment-pipelines.md %}) in your deployment pipelines.

Whether in your test or deployment pipelines, you will want to call the Honeycomb API, similar to:

```shell
curl https://api.honeycomb.io/1/batch/Dataset%20Name -X POST \
  -H "YOUR TEAM: YOUR_WRITE_KEY" \
  -d '[
        {
          "time":"2017-02-09T02:00:00Z",
          "data":{"key1":"val1","key2":"val2"}
        },
        {
          "data":{"key3":"val3"}
        }
      ]'
```

### Using Honeymarker

Honeycomb also provides [Honeymarker](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeymarker) to make it even easier to use markets within your specific datasets.

#### Installing Honeymarker

To use [Honeymarker](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeymarker), you will need to install the tool by adding a couple of new commands to your project's [setup commands]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/quickstart/getting-started.md %}):

```shell
$ go get github.com/honeycombio/honeymarker
$ honeymarker
```

**Note** that Honeymarker installs via `go get`, which is configured by default on Codeship Basic build machines.

#### Running Honeymarker Commands

Once you have Honeymarker installed via your project's setup commands, you will need to add new commands to your project's [test commands]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/quickstart/getting-started.md %}) to make use of it:

```shell
honeymarker -k <your-writekey> -d <dataset> COMMAND [command-specific flags]
```

You can view the [Honeymarker documentation](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeymarker) for a full list of commands that you can use.
