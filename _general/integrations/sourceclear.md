## About SourceClear

SourceClear is as service for automatically testing and reporting on your application's security vulnerabilities.

By using SourceClear you can be sure that your application code is tested and secure.

[Their documentation](https://www.sourceclear.com/docs/) does a great job of providing more information, in addition to the setup instructions below.

## Codeship Pro

### Setting Your API Token

To start, you need to add your SourceClear API token to your [encrypted environment variables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/environment-variables.md %}) that you encrypt and include in your [codeship-services.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/services.md %}).

### Adding Commands

After adding the API token, you will need to add the following commands to a script, placed in your repository, that you will call from your [codeship-steps.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/steps.md %}):


```shell
curl -sSL https://download.sourceclear.com/ci.sh | bash
```

**Note** that if you are using [parallel test steps]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/steps.md %}) then you likely only want to call this script once, as it's own step, rather than as part of your test steps themselves.

## Codeship Basic

### Setting Your API Token

To start, you need to add your SourceClear API token to your [environment variables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/builds-and-configuration/set-environment-variables.md %}).

You can do this by navigating to _Project Settings_ and then clicking on the _Environment_ tab.

### Adding Commands

After adding the API token, you'll just need to add the SourceClear command to your [project's test commands[project's test commands]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/quickstart/getting-started.md %})]. The command to add is:

```shell
curl -sSL https://download.sourceclear.com/ci.sh | bash
```

**Note** that if you are using [parallel test pipelines]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/builds-and-configuration/parallel-tests.md %}) then you likely only want to add this command to a single pipeline, rather than multiple pipelines.
