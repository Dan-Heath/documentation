## About Codecov

Codecov is an automated code coverage service. Starting with Codecov and Codeship is fast and easy.

By using Codecov you can help enforce higher standards of code quality and transparency with your engineering team.

[Their documentation](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/) does a great job of providing more information, in addition to the setup instructions below.

## Codeship Pro

### Adding Upload Token

To start, you need to add your `CODECOV_TOKEN` to the [encrypted environment variables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/environment-variables.md %}) that you encrypt and include in your [codeship-services.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/services.md %}).

### Project Configuration

Once your Codecov upload token is loaded via your environment variables, you will need to add the Codecov reporting command as a new step in your [codeship-steps.yml file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/steps.md %}).

After running your test commands, you can add:

```yaml
- name: codecov
  service: YOURSERVICE
  command: bash -c "curl -s https://codecov.io/bash"
```

**Note** that this uses their universal uploader. They also provide language and framework-specific packages that you can integrate directly into your test suite if you prefer. [View their language-specific documentation and examples](https://github.com/codecov/example-ruby) for more specific information.

## Codeship Basic

### Adding Upload Token

To start, you need to add your `CODECOV_TOKEN` to your to your project's [environment variables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/builds-and-configuration/set-environment-variables.md %}).

You can do this by navigating to _Project Settings_ and then clicking on the _Environment_ tab.

### Project Configuration

Once your Codecov upload token is loaded via your environment variables, you will need to add the Codecov reporting command in your [test commands]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/quickstart/getting-started.md %}):

```shell
bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)
```

**Note** that this uses their universal uploader. They also provide language and framework-specific packages that you can integrate directly into your test suite if you prefer.
