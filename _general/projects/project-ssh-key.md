For communication between your Codeship project and outside via SSH, you will need your project's SSH public key which you can find in your project settings.

* Select a project and then click _Project Settings_ in the upper right corner
* Then click _General_ in the upper right corner
* Scroll down until you find the _SSH public key_ section

If you need more information on how to use SSH and similar tools, see [Deployment via FTP, SFTP, SCP, RSYNC, and SSH]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/continuous-deployment/deployment-with-ftp-sftp-scp.md %}).

## Reset the SSH Key

If you need to reset the SSH key pair for the project you can use the _Reset project SSH key_ button. This will generate a new SSH key pair and also add the new key to your source control provider.

## Use Case Examples

* You are deploying to one of your own servers instead of using Codeship's integrations to services like AWS and Heroku.

* Your deployment script has a few more commands you want to be executed and you want to deploy to another service directly.

* You are using SSH tunnels to connect to your database within your tests.
