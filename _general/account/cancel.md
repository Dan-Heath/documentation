## How To Delete Your User Account

To completely delete your Codeship user account, navigate to _Personal Settings_ in the upper right corner. At the bottom of that page is a button to delete your account. This will completely remove your access to Codeship and remove your user and user data. **This action cannot be undone.**

If you are interested in cancelling your subscription or deleting your organization account checkout the corresponding sections on the [organization account article]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _general/account/organizations.md %}) here:
* [Cancel Your Billing Subscription]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _general/account/organizations.md %}#cancel-your-billing-subscription)
* [Delete Your Organization Account]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _general/account/organizations.md %}#delete-your-organization-account)
