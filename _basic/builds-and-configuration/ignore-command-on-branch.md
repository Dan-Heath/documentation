## What is including or excluding a specific branch?

For a variety of reasons, you may want to either _only run_ commands on certain branches (i.e. only run custom alert commands on the `master` branch) or _exclude_ commands from running on certain branches (i.e. never run acceptance tests if on a branch that starts with `feature/*`).

Below you will find scripts that you can use on your project's [setup and test commands]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/quickstart/getting-started.md %}) to accomplish both scenarios.

{% csnote info %}
These commands must be entered as single lines in your setup or test commands to be executed properly. Multiple line commands will get treated as separate commands instead of a single command. If you want to write a longer command as multiple lines, you should write it in a script file and then call that script instead.
{% endcsnote %}

## Using Include / Exclude Commands Per Branch

### Skip A Command On Specific Branches

If you don't want to run a command on a specific branch use the following syntax. In this example we run your command on every branch except `gh_pages`.

```shell
if [ "$CI_BRANCH" != "gh-pages" ]; then YOUR_COMMAND; fi
```

### Only Run A Command On Specific Branches

If you want to run a specific command only on one branch use the following syntax. In this example we run your command only on the master branch.

```shell
if [ "$CI_BRANCH" == "master" ]; then YOUR_COMMAND; fi
```

### Example Using A Pattern

If you want to use a pattern instead of a specific value, you need to follow the correct syntax. For example: if you want to run a command for all branches that start with `feature/`. Here is the syntax you would use:

```shell
if [[ "$CI_BRANCH" =~ "feature/"* ]]; then YOUR_COMMAND; fi
```
