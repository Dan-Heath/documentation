[Redis](https://redis.io) `4.0.9` runs on the default port **6379** and doesn't require any credentials.

## Other Versions

If you need to install a different version or use a custom configuration, please see [this script](https://github.com/codeship/scripts/blob/master/packages/redis.sh).

For example if you want to install **5.0.3**, set that version as an [environment variable]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/builds-and-configuration/set-environment-variables.md %}) in your project or add this in the _Setup Commands_:

```
export REDIS_VERSION=5.0.3
```

Next, add [this command](https://github.com/codeship/scripts/blob/master/packages/redis.sh#L6) to your _Setup Commands_ and the script will automatically be called at build time. Note, this script will automatically start the Redis service on the default port.

```
\curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeship/scripts/master/packages/redis.sh | bash -s
```
